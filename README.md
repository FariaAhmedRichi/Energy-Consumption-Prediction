# Household Energy Consumption Prediction

This project focuses on predicting household energy consumption using machine learning. I worked through raw data, cleaned and prepared it, and then applied classification models to generate useful insights.

## 📌 What This Project Is About
I used a real-world dataset to explore energy usage patterns and built models to predict consumption levels. The goal was to not just build models, but understand what drives energy usage and how to make sense of that data.
  ⚙️ Preprocessing was done in R to clean and prepare the dataset, which was then used in a Python-based machine learning workflow.

## 🛠️ What I Did
- Cleaned and preprocessed messy data
- Handled missing values, and feature selection
- Trained classification models using scikit-learn
- Compared models using evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score.
- Visualized results with Seaborn and Matplotlib

## 📊 Tools & Libraries
- R (RStudio)
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn


## 💡 Why This Matters
As someone who enjoys making raw data speak, this project helped me dig into a practical problem and apply data science techniques that are useful in real-world scenarios.
